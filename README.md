### **Real Estate Price Analysis Project**

>> This project aims to identify key variables that influence house prices in the residential real estate market. By analyzing and visualizing data, the goal is to provide actionable insights that will help the real estate company optimize its pricing strategy and identify new market opportunities.

>> House prices in the real estate market are influenced by a wide range of dynamic factors. As part of the analytics team in a real estate company, your task is to analyze a dataset to determine which variables significantly impact house prices. These insights will help the company make more informed decisions for pricing and investment strategies.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project, housing_data.csv, contains multiple features related to properties, such as:

1. MSSubClass: Type of dwelling involved in the sale.
2. MSZoning: General zoning classification of the sale.
3. LotFrontage: Linear feet of street connected to the property.
4. LotArea: Lot size in square feet.
5. Neighborhood: Physical location within city limits.
6. OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
7. YearBuilt: Original construction date.
8. SaleType: Type of sale.
9. SaleCondition: Condition of the sale and many other features.

### **Project Objectives**

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and data types.

2. **Univariate Analysis:** Examine individual variables to understand their distributions and identify key patterns.

3. **Multivariate Analysis:** Investigate relationships between multiple variables to determine their combined effect on house prices.
   
4. **Data Visualization:** Use different visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots, box plots, histograms) to present the data and discover patterns.
   
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Assess the strength of relationships between different variables and the target variable (house price).
   
6. **Feature Engineering:** Identify and create the most relevant features for predictive modeling.

### **Tools and Libraries**

* Python: Main programming language for data analysis.

* NumPy: For numerical computations.

* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

* SciPy: For statistical analysis.

* Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.

### **Project Structure**
